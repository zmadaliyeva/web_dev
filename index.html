    <h1>Title of Poem</h1>
    
    <p>
        <strong>Nobody’s born smart.</strong> We all start at 0. <em>Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.</em><br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike. <strong>Nobody’s good at anything at first.</strong><br>
        There was a time when <strong>Einstein couldn’t count to 10.</strong><br>
        And <strong>Shakespeare had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.</strong><br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, fall and fail and fall.<br>
        <em>Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.</em><br>
        Until one day, you walk.<br>
        One foot in front of the other. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <em>This. is. learning.</em><br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        <em>You just don’t get it, yet.</em><br>
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>You only have to know one thing:</strong><br>
        <em>You can learn anything.</em>

    </p>
    <p>The <strong>kangaroo</strong> is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning 'large foot'). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus Macropus, red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia, and one genus, the tree-kangaroo, is also found in Papua New Guinea.</p>

    <p>Kangaroos have large, powerful hind legs, large feet adapted for leaping, a long muscular tail for balance, and a small head. Like most marsupials, female kangaroos have a pouch called a marsupium in which joeys complete postnatal development.</p>

    <p>Larger kangaroos have adapted much better than smaller macropods to land clearing for pastoral agriculture and habitat changes brought to the Australian landscape by humans. Many of the smaller species are rare and endangered, whilst the larger kangaroos are relatively plentiful.</p>
    
    
    <h3 id="locomotion">Locomotion</h3>
    
    <p>A Tasmanian forester (eastern grey) kangaroo in motion.
    Kangaroos are the only large animals to use hopping as a means of locomotion. The comfortable hopping speed for a red kangaroo is about 20–25 km/h (13–16 mph), but speeds of up to 70 km/h (44 mph) can be attained over short distances, while it can sustain a speed of 40 km/h (25 mph) for nearly 2 km (1.2 mi). This fast and energy-efficient method of travel has evolved because of the need to regularly cover large distances in search of food and water, rather than the need to escape predators. At slow speeds, it employs pentapedal locomotion, using its tail to form a tripod with its two forelimbs while bringing its hind feet forward. Kangaroos are adept swimmers, and often flee into waterways if threatened by a predator. If pursued into the water, a kangaroo may use its forepaws to hold the predator underwater so as to drown it.</p>

    <h3 id="diet">Diet</h3>
    
    <p>Kangaroos have chambered stomachs similar to those of cattle and sheep. They regurgitate the vegetation they have eaten, chew it as cud, and then swallow it again for final digestion. Different species of kangaroos have different diets, although all are strict herbivores. The eastern grey kangaroo is predominantly a grazer, eating a wide variety of grasses, whereas some other species (e.g. the red kangaroo) include significant amounts of shrubs in their diets. The smaller species of kangaroos also consume hypogeal fungi. Many species are nocturnal, and crepuscular, usually spending the days resting in shade, and the cool evenings, nights and mornings moving about and feeding.</p>

    <p>Because of its grazing habits, the kangaroo has developed specialized teeth. Its incisors are able to crop grass close to the ground, and its molars chop and grind the grass. Since the two sides of the lower jaw are not joined together, the lower incisors are farther apart, giving the kangaroo a wider bite. The silica in grass is abrasive, so kangaroo molars move forward as they are ground down, and eventually fall out, replaced by new teeth that grow in the back. This process is known as polyphyodonty and amongst other mammals, only occurs in elephants and manatees.</p>

    <h1>Groupers</h1>
    
    <p><span class="first-sentence">Groupers are teleosts (ray-finned fishes), 
        typically having a stout body and a large mouth.</span> They can be 
        quite large, and lengths over a meter and weights up to 100 kg are 
        not uncommon, though obviously in such a large group, species vary 
        considerably. They swallow prey rather than biting pieces off it. 
        They do not have many teeth on the edges of their jaws, but they 
        have heavy crushing tooth plates inside the pharynx. They habitually 
        eat fish, octopuses, and crustaceans. Reports of fatal attacks on 
        humans by the largest species, the giant grouper (Epinephelus 
        lanceolatus) are unconfirmed.</p>

    <p><span class="first-sentence">Their mouths and gills form a powerful 
        sucking system that sucks their prey in from a distance.</span> 
        They also use their mouths to dig into sand to form their shelters 
        under big rocks, jetting it out through their gills. Their gill 
        muscles are so powerful, it is nearly impossible to pull them out 
        of a cave if they feel attacked and extend those muscles to lock 
        themselves in.</p>

    <h1>The ocean</h1>
        
    <img class="pic" src="https://www.kasandbox.org/programming-images/landscapes/beach-in-hawaii.png" alt="Photo of rocky ocean beach in Hawaii">
    
    <div class="info">
        <p>The <strong>ocean</strong> is the connected body of salty water that covers 70.8% of the Earth's surface. The sea moderates the Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been travelled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the sea—oceanography—dates broadly to the British Challenger expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into four or five large sections, such as the Pacific, called oceans while smaller sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as seas.
        </p>
        <p>
        Owing to the present state of continental drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium and chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by the rotation of the Earth (the Coriolis effect).

    <div id="cloud-sidebar">
        <h5>Why are some clouds yellow?</h5>
        <p>Yellowish clouds may occur in the late spring through early fall months during forest fire season. The yellow color is due to the presence of pollutants in the smoke. Yellowish clouds caused by the presence of nitrogen dioxide are sometimes seen in urban areas with high air pollution levels.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>In meteorology, a cloud is a visible mass of liquid droplets or frozen crystals made of water or various chemicals suspended in the atmosphere above the surface of a planetary body. These suspended particles are also known as aerosols and are studied in the cloud physics branch of meteorology.</p>

    <p>Terrestrial cloud formation is the result of air in Earth's atmosphere becoming saturated due to either or both of two processes: cooling of the air and adding water vapor. With sufficient saturation, precipitation will fall to the surface.</p>
